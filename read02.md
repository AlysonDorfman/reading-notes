## Choosing a Text Editor

### Things to look for: 

* Code Completion 
* Shorthand (Emmet for HTML and CSS)
* Syntax Highlighting (Color Coding)
* Themes
* Extensions

There exist text editors that come built into operating systems, but they usually lack some of the robust features we're looking for, so it's wise to choose from a third-party option.

### Third-Party Options

* NotePad++
* TextWrangler: outdated, now folded into BB Edit
* BB Edit
* Visual Studio Code: Free, made by MSFT, available on most machines, has Emmet
* Atom: Made by GitHub
* Brackets: Made by Adobe, only supports HTML, CSS and Java so may be good for beginners. Has live preview.
* Sublime Text: $70

### Text Editors vs. IDEs

IDE: Integrated Development Enviroment

An IDE is a text editor **and**, in addition, a file manager, compiler, and debugger. Just like MSFT Outlook is not just email, it's also a calendar, task manager, etc. It's a whole suite of software.
