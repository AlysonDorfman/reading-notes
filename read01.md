# Markdown Notes

Markdown, a versatile markup language, allows for various formatting and content elements. Headings are created by adding '#' symbols, while best practices recommend including spaces for compatibility. Paragraphs are separated by blank lines, and it's important not to indent them, unless specific formatting requirements dictate otherwise.

Images can be displayed using '![alt text](image link)' syntax, making them accessible and enhancing content. GitHub supports embedding images in various contexts, offering flexibility in sourcing and displaying images. Relative links are used for images in repositories, allowing for easy referencing.

Markdown also supports lists, both ordered and unordered, as well as nested lists. Unordered lists can be created using '-', '*', or '+', while ordered lists are numbered. Nested lists are achieved by indenting items, with the web editor or a text editor using a monospaced font offering visual alignment. In the comment editor on GitHub, counting characters before content determines indentation. These features make Markdown a powerful tool for structuring content, especially in GitHub repositories.
