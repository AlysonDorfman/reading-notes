# Read: 04 - Structure web pages with HTML


## What is HTML and why do we use it?

HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is a standard markup language used for creating the structure and content of web pages. HTML uses various tags to define and organize the elements and content on a webpage, such as headings, paragraphs, links, images, forms, and more. It provides a structured way to present information on the internet and is essential for creating and formatting web pages. HTML is the backbone of web development, as it is used to define the structure and content of web documents, enabling browsers to render web pages correctly.

## What are the 3 main parts of an HTML element?

An HTML element consists of three main parts:

**Opening Tag:** The opening tag is the first part of an HTML element and encloses the element's name. It signifies the beginning of the element and contains attributes (optional) that provide additional information about the element.

**Content:** The content of an HTML element is the information or text enclosed between the opening and closing tags. It is the actual content that is displayed or processed by the browser.

**Closing Tag:** The closing tag is the last part of an HTML element and is denoted by the element's name enclosed in angle brackets with a forward slash (/). It signifies the end of the element and mirrors the opening tag.

### For example:

\<p>This is a paragraph element.\</p>

In this example, \<p> is the opening tag, "This is a paragraph element." is the content, and \</p> is the closing tag.

## What is it called when you give an element extra information?

When you provide additional information or attributes to an HTML element, it is called "attribute" or "tag attribute." Attributes provide extra information about an element, which can be used by browsers, scripts, or CSS for various purposes. Attributes are specified within the opening tag of an HTML element and are written as name-value pairs.

### For example:


\<img src="image.jpg" alt="Description of the image">

In this example, src and alt are attributes of the \<img> element, providing information about the image source and alternative text.

## What is a semantic element?

A semantic element in HTML is an element that carries meaning or conveys the structural and contextual information of the content it encloses. Semantic elements provide a way to describe the purpose of the content, making it more understandable not only to developers but also to search engines, assistive technologies, and other tools.

Examples of semantic elements include \<header>, \<nav>, \<main>, \<article>, \<section>, \<aside>, \<footer>, and more. These elements are used to define the structure and organization of web content, making it clear what each part of the content represents. Semantic elements are crucial for creating accessible, well-structured, and SEO-friendly web pages. They help browsers and other technologies interpret the content's meaning and function.
