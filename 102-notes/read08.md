# Read: 07 - Operators and Loops

## Expressions

An expression in JavaScript is a combination of values, variables, operators, and functions that can be evaluated to produce a single value. It represents a computation and can be as simple as a single value or as complex as a mathematical formula.

## Loops

We use loops in our code to execute a block of code repeatedly based on a specified condition. Loops are valuable for automating repetitive tasks, processing collections of data, and iterating through arrays or other data structures.

### For Loops
A for loop stops executing when the condition specified in the loop header becomes false. In a typical for loop, the condition is checked before each iteration, and when it evaluates to false, the loop terminates, and the program continues with the code after the loop.

## While Loops
The number of times a while loop executes depends on the condition specified in the loop. The loop will continue to execute as long as the condition evaluates to true. It's important to ensure that the condition eventually becomes false to avoid infinite loops. The exact number of iterations can vary based on the condition and the values involved.
