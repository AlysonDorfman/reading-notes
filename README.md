# ‚úçÔ∏è Reading Notes

üëã Hello, all! My name is Alyson Dorfman (she/her), I live in the Sierra Nevada foothills of California, originally from Seattle. My background is in business development within healthcare. Previous experience includes leading the expansion of a Texas-based healthcare group into Seattle and partnering with large employer groups like Costco and REI.  I'm excited for this curriculum to utilize as I break into the tech industry and expand my knowledge. Can't wait to see what we can do with emerging AI, too! I'm currently running Windows 11 Home 22H2 on a Microsoft Surface. Looking forward to working with you all!
