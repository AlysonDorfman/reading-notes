# My reading journal for Code Fellows

Growth Mindset in my own words: It's the view that challenges and setbacks are opportunities for growth and that talents are not innate but can be nurtured and enhanced over time through dedication and a willingness to embrace new experiences. In essence, it's the mindset that fosters a continuous desire for improvement and the pursuit of higher goals.

Reminders to Myself to maintain a growth mindset: 

Challenges Foster Growth: View coding challenges as chances to improve. When you encounter a tough coding problem, remember that it's an opportunity to enhance your problem-solving skills.

Progress Over Perfection: Don't aim for perfect code; aim for progress. Understand that writing bug-free code isn't always possible, but each coding session is a chance to learn and refine your skills.

Celebrate Milestones: Recognize your achievements in software development, even the small ones. Completing a project module or solving a complex bug are steps forward in your growth as a software engineer. Acknowledge and celebrate these milestones to stay motivated.
