# ‚úçÔ∏è My reading journal for Code Fellows

üëã Hello, all! My name is Alyson Dorfman (she/her), I'm living in the Lake Tahoe area of California, originally from Seattle. My background is in business development within healthcare. Previous experience includes leading the expansion of a Texas-based healthcare group into Seattle and partnering with large employer groups like Costco and REI.  I'm excited for this class to break into the tech industry and expand my knowledge. Can't wait to see what we can do with emerging AI, too! I'm currently running Windows 11 Home 22H2 on a Microsoft Surface. Looking forward to working with you all!

## Growth Mindset 

‚¨ÜÔ∏è **Growth Mindset** in my own words: It's the view that challenges and setbacks are opportunities for growth and that talents are not innate but can be nurtured and enhanced over time through dedication and a willingness to embrace new experiences. In essence, it's the mindset that fosters a continuous desire for improvement and the pursuit of higher goals.

üéóÔ∏è *Reminders* to Myself to maintain a growth mindset: 

1. Challenges Foster Growth: View coding challenges as chances to improve. When you encounter a tough coding problem, remember that it's an opportunity to enhance your problem-solving skills.

2. Progress Over Perfection: Don't aim for perfect code; aim for progress. Understand that writing bug-free code isn't always possible, but each coding session is a chance to learn and refine your skills.

3. Celebrate Milestones: Recognize your achievements in software development, even the small ones. Completing a project module or solving a complex bug are steps forward in your growth as a software engineer. Acknowledge and celebrate these milestones to stay motivated.
