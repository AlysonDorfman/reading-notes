- What is a key difference between fixed positioning and absolute positioning?

*Fixed Positioning:* When an element is fixed, it remains in a fixed position relative to the viewport. This means it stays in the same place on the screen even if the user scrolls. Fixed elements are often used for things like headers or navigation bars that should remain visible at all times.

*Absolute Positioning:* An absolutely positioned element is positioned relative to its closest positioned ancestor. If no positioned ancestor is found, it is positioned relative to the initial containing block, which is usually the viewport. Absolute elements are not affected by scrolling in the same way as fixed elements; they maintain their position relative to their containing block or the viewpor

## Learn JS: Functions - Reusable Blocks of Code

- Describe the difference between a function declaration and a function invocation.
> It defines a reusable piece of code but does not execute it immediately. Instead, it makes the function available for later use.
- What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?
> A parameter is a variable or placeholder in a function's definition (declaration) that represents a value the function expects to receive when it is called. An argument is the actual value or expression that is provided to a function when it is invoked. It is the real data that matches the parameters defined in the function declaration.
