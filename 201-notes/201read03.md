# Read: 03 - HTML Lists, Control Flow with JS, and the CSS Box Model

This topic matters especially the structure learned here is the backbone of industry standard structure, and we need to be prepared to work cohesively when we enter the market. 

### Learn HTML Ordered and Unordered Lists.

1. **When should you use an unordered list in your HTML document?**
   - Use an unordered list when the order of items is not important, and you want to create a bulleted list.

2. **How do you change the bullet style of unordered list items?**
   - You can change the bullet style using CSS with the `list-style-type` property.

3. **When should you use an ordered list vs an unordered list in your HTML document?**
   - Use an ordered list when the order of items is important, and you want to create a numbered list.

4. **Describe two ways you can change the numbers on list items provided by an ordered list?**
   - You can change the numbering style using CSS with the `list-style-type` property or the `start` attribute on the `<ol>` element.

### Learn CSS The Box Model.

1. **Describe the CSS properties of margin and padding as characters in a story. What is their role in a story titled: “The Box Model”?**
   - In "The Box Model," margin is like the wide-open spaces around a house, while padding is the cozy area just inside the walls.

2. **List and describe the four parts of an HTML element's box as referred to by the box model.**
   - Content: The actual content or text.
   - Padding: The space between the content and the border.
   - Border: The line that surrounds the padding.
   - Margin: The space outside the border.

### Learn JS Arrays. Operators and Expressions. Conditionals. Loops.

1. **What data types can you store inside of an Array?**
   - Arrays in JavaScript can store any data types, including numbers, strings, objects, and even other arrays.

2. **Is the people array a valid JavaScript array? If so, how can I access the values stored? If not, why?**
   ```javascript
   const people = [['pete', 32, 'librarian', null], ['Smith', 40, 'accountant', 'fishing:hiking:rock_climbing'], ['bill', null, 'artist', null]];

3. **List five shorthand operators for assignment in JavaScript and describe what they do.**
- `+=`: Adds the right operand to the left operand and assigns the result to the left operand.
- `-=`: Subtracts the right operand from the left operand and assigns the result to the left operand.
- `*=`: Multiplies the left operand by the right operand and assigns the result to the left operand.
- `/=`: Divides the left operand by the right operand and assigns the result to the left operand.
- `%=`: Assigns the remainder of the left operand divided by the right operand to the left operand.

4. **Read the code below and evaluate the last expression and explain what the result would be and why.**
```javascript
let a = 10;
let b = 'dog';
let c = false;

// evaluate this
(a + c) + b;
// The result would be the string '10falsetrue' because JavaScript converts the boolean `false` to the string 'false' when attempting to concatenate.

5. **Describe a real-world example of when a conditional statement should be used in a JavaScript program.**
- A conditional statement could be used to check if a user is logged in, and if not, redirect them to a login page.

Give an example of when a Loop is useful in JavaScript.
- A loop could be used to iterate over items in an array and perform a specific action on each item, such as displaying them on a webpage.
