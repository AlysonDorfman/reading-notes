# Read: 01 - Setup Developer Toolbelt

This topic matters especially within this module of learning because it provides the framework and context to understand what's happening between the user, client and server. That context will expand the scope of what the user can do. 

If there are no questions provided, summarize and explain this topic via an analogy from your previous work or home experience.

## Getting Started

### A short poem on HTTP

Through the digital realm, like a whisper it flies,
HTTP, the messenger, 'neath vast virtual skies.
It carries our data, from server to device,
In packets of information, it rolls like a dice.

### Describe how HTML, CSS, and JS files are “parsed” in the browser

HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files are parsed in the browser as follows:

HTML Parsing:

The browser requests and downloads the HTML file.
The HTML parser reads the code, creating a DOM tree that represents the page's structure.
CSS Parsing:

If there are external CSS files or inline styles, the browser downloads and processes them.
The CSS parser interprets rules, calculates styles, and applies them to HTML elements.
JavaScript Parsing:

When encountering /<script> tags or external JS files, the browser downloads and parses JavaScript.
It creates an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) for code structure and executes it to enhance interactivity.
These processes enable browsers to render web pages, with each step contributing to the final presentation and functionality.

### How can you find images to add to a Website?

Stock Photo Websites, Creative Commons sources, Free Image Resources, Paid Image Resources, Your Own Photos, Design Tools, Public Domain Resources, Government and Educational Institutions, Image Search Engines, Custom Illustrations.

### How do you create a String vs a Number in JavaScript?

/const myString = "Hello, World!";

/const myNumber = 42;

### What is a Variable and why are they important in JavaScript?

Variables in JavaScript are named containers for storing data, facilitating data manipulation and dynamic typing. They enable code reusability, scope control, and are vital for building interactive and responsive web applications. Variables also play a key role in debugging and managing complex data structures.


## Introduction to HTML

### What is an HTML attribute?

An HTML attribute is a property or characteristic that provides additional information about an HTML element.
Attributes are added to the opening tag of an element and help define its behavior, appearance, or functionality.

### Describe the Anatomy of an HTML element.

An HTML element consists of an opening tag, content, and a closing tag.
The opening tag contains the element's name and any attributes.
The content is the information or nested elements contained within.
The closing tag mirrors the opening tag but includes a forward slash before the element name.

### What is the Difference between <article> and <section> element tags?

The <article> element is used to represent a self-contained, independent piece of content, such as a news article.
The <section> element is more generic and used for grouping related content within a document, without implying independence.

### What Elements does a “typical” website include?

A typical website includes elements like <header>, <nav>, <main>, <aside>, <footer>, and various combinations of content elements like <article>, <section>, <p>, and links using <a>.

### How does metadata influence Search Engine Optimization?

Metadata, such as meta title and description tags, influence SEO by providing concise and relevant information about a web page.
Search engines use this metadata to understand and rank web pages in search results, making it crucial for visibility.

### How is the <meta> HTML tag used when specifying metadata?

The <meta> tag is used within the <head> section of an HTML document.
It contains metadata like character encoding, viewport settings, and SEO-related data.
For SEO, the <meta name="description"> tag provides a brief summary of the page's content, while <meta name="keywords"> lists relevant keywords.

### What is a Function in JavaScript?

A function in JavaScript is a reusable block of code that performs a specific task.
It can take input, known as parameters, and can return a result.
Functions help organize and modularize code, promoting reusability.
How do you declare a Variable in JavaScript?

Use var, let, or const followed by the variable name to declare it.
Example: let myVariable = "Hello";
What is an Array in JavaScript?

An array in JavaScript is an ordered collection of values, stored in a single variable.
You can access array elements by their index, starting from 0.
Arrays are versatile and commonly used for storing lists of data.
Explain the Purpose of Conditional Statements in JavaScript.

Conditional statements, like if, else if, and else, allow you to make decisions in your code.
They execute specific code blocks based on conditions (e.g., true or false).
This control flow is essential for creating dynamic and responsive programs.
What Does DOM Stand For, and Why Is It Important?

DOM stands for Document Object Model.
It's a representation of the structure and content of a web page in a hierarchical tree-like format.
JavaScript interacts with the DOM to manipulate web page content, enabling dynamic web applications.
