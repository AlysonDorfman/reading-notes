### Using Images In HTML. Read Common Image Types and Choosing Image Formats.

1. **What is a real-world use case for the alt attribute being used in a website?**
   - The `alt` attribute is crucial for accessibility, providing a text description of an image for users with visual impairments and serving as alternative content if the image fails to load.

2. **How can you improve the accessibility of images in an HTML document?**
   - By using descriptive and concise `alt` attributes, providing text equivalents for complex images, and ensuring good contrast between the image and its background.

3. **Provide an example of when the figure element would be useful in an HTML document.**
   - The `figure` element is useful when you want to associate a caption (`figcaption`) with an image, diagram, or any other content that is referenced in the main flow of the document.

4. **Describe the difference between a gif image and an svg image, pretend you are explaining to an elder in your community.**
   - A GIF image is like a series of pictures played in a sequence, often used for simple animations, while an SVG image is like a set of instructions that tells the computer how to draw an image, like a digital blueprint.

5. **What image type would you use to display a screenshot on your website and why?**
   - PNG would be a suitable image type for displaying a screenshot on a website because it supports lossless compression, preserving the quality of the screenshot without introducing artifacts.

### Learn CSS Using Color in CSS. Styling HTML Text Elements.

1. **Describe the difference between foreground and background colors of an HTML element, pretend you are talking to someone with no technical knowledge.**
   - Foreground color is the color of the text or content inside an element, like the ink on a piece of paper, while background color is the color of the paper itself, surrounding the content.

2. **Your friend asks you to give his colorless blog website a touch up. How would you use color to give his blog some character?**
   - I would suggest adding a harmonious color scheme to the text, backgrounds, and accents, using colors that complement each other to create a visually appealing and cohesive design.

3. **What should you consider when choosing fonts for an HTML document?**
   - Consider the readability, appropriateness for the content and audience, and the overall aesthetic of the document. Choose fonts that enhance the user experience.

4. **What do font-size, font-weight, and font-style do to HTML text elements?**
   - `font-size` adjusts the size of the text, `font-weight` controls the thickness or boldness, and `font-style` determines whether the text is in normal, italic, or oblique style.

5. **Describe two ways you could add spacing around the characters displayed in an h1 element.**
   - Use the `letter-spacing` property in CSS to increase or decrease space between characters, or use the `margin` or `padding` properties to add space around the entire h1 element.
