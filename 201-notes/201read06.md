# Read: 06 - Problem Domain, Objects, and the DOM

### JavaScript Object Basics

1. **How would you describe an object to a non-technical friend you grew up with?**
   - An object is like a container that holds related information and actions, representing a single entity.

2. **What are some advantages to creating object literals?**
   - Object literals allow for the creation of structured data with properties and methods in a convenient and readable way.

3. **How do objects differ from arrays?**
   - Objects store data using key-value pairs, providing named properties, while arrays use numeric indices for ordered collections of values.

4. **Give an example for when you would need to use bracket notation to access an objectâ€™s property instead of dot notation.**
   - When the property name contains special characters or starts with a number, bracket notation is necessary, like `obj['property-name']`.

5. **Evaluate the code below. What does the term this refer to, and what is the advantage of using this?**
   ```javascript
   const dog = {
     name: 'Spot',
     age: 2,
     color: 'white with black spots',
     humanAge: function () {
       console.log(`${this.name} is ${this.age * 7} in human years`);
     }
   }
   ```
  - The term this refers to the current object (dog), and using this allows the method (humanAge) to access and use the properties of the object it belongs to.

### Introduction To The DOM

1. **What is the DOM?**
   - The DOM (Document Object Model) is a programming interface for web documents, providing a structured representation that allows scripts to dynamically access and modify the content, structure, and style of a document.

2. **Briefly describe the relationship between the DOM and JavaScript.**
   - JavaScript interacts with the DOM to dynamically manipulate and update the content, structure, and style of a web page in response to user actions or events.
