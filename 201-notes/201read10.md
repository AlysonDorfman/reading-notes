### What Went Wrong? Troubleshooting JavaScript.

**Name some key differences between a Syntax Error and a Logic Error.**

Syntax Error:

Definition: Syntax errors occur when the code violates the language's grammatical rules.
Cause: Usually caused by typos, missing or misplaced punctuation, or incorrect language usage.
Detection: Detected by the interpreter or compiler during the code compilation or interpretation.
Effect: Prevents the program from running or compiling successfully.
Logic Error:

Definition: Logic errors occur when the code is grammatically correct but produces unexpected or incorrect results due to flawed logic.
Cause: Caused by mistakes in the algorithm or the overall flow of the program.
Detection: Often more challenging to detect as the code will run without throwing errors.
Effect: Leads to incorrect program behavior, where the output doesn't match the intended functionality.

**List a few types of errors that you have encountered in past lab assignments and explain how you were able to correct them.**

In the Lab with the alerts, I recall the alerts not showing up in the order I intended and erroring out with certain input. I corrected them through trial and error, to understand exactly what was causing the unintended result and then fixing it at the source. 

**How will this topic continue to influence your long term goals?**

It will influence my long term goals a helpful starting point to troubleshoot errors in code. Identifying exaclty where the error exists and why is the first step to correcting it. 

### The JavaScript Debugger.

**How would you describe the JavaScript Debugger tool and how it works to someone just starting out in software development?**
The JavaScript Debugger is a tool that helps developers identify and fix issues in their code by allowing them to pause execution, inspect variables, and step through code execution line by line. It works by enabling developers to set breakpoints, which are specific points in the code where execution will temporarily stop. Once paused, developers can examine the current state of variables, evaluate expressions, and navigate through the code step by step, gaining insights into the program's behavior. This tool is invaluable for diagnosing and resolving errors, making it an essential aid for those learning software development.

**Define what a breakpoint is.**
A breakpoint is a designated point in a program's code where the execution will pause, allowing developers to inspect the program's state, variables, and flow. This aids in debugging by providing an opportunity to analyze and troubleshoot the code at specific locations. Breakpoints are set by developers to interrupt the normal execution of the program, helping them identify and resolve issues in their code.

**What is the call stack?**
The call stack is a data structure in programming that keeps track of the execution context or sequence of function calls in a program. It operates on a Last In, First Out (LIFO) basis, where the most recently called function is at the top of the stack. As functions are called, they are added to the stack, and as they return, they are removed. The call stack is crucial for understanding the current state of execution and helps the program keep track of where to return after completing each function call.
