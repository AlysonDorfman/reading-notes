# Read: 07 - Object-Oriented Programming, HTML Tables

### Domain Modeling

**Explain why we need domain modeling**

Domain modeling helps us understand and represent the structure and relationships within a specific problem domain, providing a blueprint for designing and building software solutions that accurately reflect real-world scenarios.

### HTML Table Basics

**Why should tables not be used for page layouts?**

Tables should not be used for page layouts because they are intended for tabular data, and using them for layout purposes can lead to accessibility issues, hinder responsive design, and result in more complex and less maintainable code.

**List and describe 3 different semantic HTML elements used in an HTML <table>.**

tr (Table Row): Represents a row of cells in a table.

th (Table Header): Represents a header cell in a table, typically within the <thead> element.

td (Table Data): Represents a data cell in a table, typically within the <tbody> or <tfoot> element.

### Introducing Constructors

**What is a constructor and what are some advantages to using it?**
A constructor is a special method in object-oriented programming used for creating and initializing objects. It defines how an object should be instantiated and set up, providing a blueprint for creating multiple instances with similar properties and methods.

Advantages of Using Constructors:

Code Reusability: Constructors enable the creation of multiple instances with the same structure and behavior, promoting code reuse.

Initialization: Constructors provide a convenient way to set initial values for object properties when they are created.

Encapsulation: Constructors encapsulate the details of object creation and initialization within a function, making the code more modular.

Prototype Inheritance: Constructors can utilize prototype inheritance, allowing objects to share methods and properties through their prototype chain.

**How does the term this differ when used in an object literal versus when used in a constructor?**
this in Object Literal vs Constructor:

Object Literal:
In an object literal, this refers to the object itself.
Constructor:
In a constructor function, this refers to the instance being created. It dynamically binds to the instance, allowing each instance to have its own set of properties.

### Object Prototypes Using A Constructor

Explain prototypes and inheritance via an analogy from your previous work experience.
NOTE: This is a very common front end developer interview question


Analogy: The Employee Training Manual

Imagine you work in a company where each employee has a specific role and responsibilities. To streamline the onboarding process, the company has an Employee Training Manual.

Prototypes:
The Employee Training Manual serves as a prototype. It contains general information and guidelines that all employees, regardless of their roles, need to follow. This manual is like the prototype object in JavaScript, providing a common set of instructions and methods that can be shared among all employees.

Inheritance:
Now, let's say you have different departments in the company: Marketing, Sales, and IT. Each department has its own set of tasks, but they all inherit the basic guidelines from the Employee Training Manual.

In this analogy:

The Marketing Department inherits from the Employee Training Manual, gaining access to the common rules and procedures. However, it also has its own section with specific marketing strategies.

The Sales Department also inherits from the Employee Training Manual, adhering to the general rules while having its own dedicated section with sales techniques.

Similarly, the IT Department inherits from the Employee Training Manual, following the common practices and having a unique section with IT protocols.
